		<p> Welcome to my website!</p>
		<p> This is about my latest python project, a game where you are a big dot... Chasing little dots.</p>
		<p> In this game, you are a large circle, and you click in the direction you want to move, you bounce around trying to get all of the other smaller circle/square things and when you do you get points. There are also power ups that allow you to grow and speed up.</p>
		<p> I had a lot of fun doing this project, having to figure things out by myself presented a real problem for me, but with some problem solving and a little(a lot) help from the internet, I got it done.</p>

		<center><p> These are a few pitures from my game. </p></center>
		<p> This game was by far took the longest time to make and is the longest program I have ever made. The code is a little long... </p>
		<p> These are 2 snipits I took of the code. </p>

		<p> Here was our next project, making an android app using MIT's app inventor program. </p>
		<p> We were inspired by cookie clicker and decided to make a cookie clicker like game. </p>
		<p> In this game, there is a large grey bar running across the screen that says Click Me, and guess what?...... You click it. </p> 
		<p> There are different powerups that you can buy in the game, some that click automaticly for you and others that increase the value of your click. </p> 
		
		<u><p> Here are some snipits of our code. </p></u>
